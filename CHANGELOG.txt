2020-06-10 - Version 3.3.0
    - Functional Changes
        - New colors: no repeats and readable for both white and black
          backgrouns
        - Don't generate colored output if terminal is not a tty  
        - Screen width is now considered the maximum width, not the required
          width
        - When in detached head state, branch name is output from
          `git describe` rather than just "DETACHED HEAD"   

    - New Features
        - New commandline options:
            --color
            --no-color
            --max-width
            --no-optional-locks
        - gmon script to run gitsummary.py in a loop
        - gitsummaryShellHelper.sh -- a tool for getting git information for
          your shell prompt

    - Other Changes
        - Redundant calls to git have been removed, resulting in a significant
          performance increase for large repositories
    
    - Known Issues
        - Python doesn't think mintty is a tty thus:
            - gitsummary produces no color (use --color to force color)
            - gitsummary doesn't truncate any output lines (use --max-width N to
              specify the width to use)
    
2019-05-05 - Version 3.2.0
    - Change terminology to be more consistent with git:
        - 'Modified' heading is now 'Work Dir'

        -  'staged'   --> 'stage'
        -  'modified' --> 'workdir'

    - New Features:
        - New section "Unmerged" (and the corresponding
          '--custom' section 'unmerged')

        - Properly handle case where a file is changed in the Stage and the

          of stashes, staged, modified, untracked, and branch sections
        - Branch output can be restricted to current branch only

    - Bug Fixes:
        - Handle detached head state properly
        - Gracefully handle lack of master and/or dev branches

2017-03-34 - Version 2.0.0

                --branch, --compareto, --current, --long, --current options
