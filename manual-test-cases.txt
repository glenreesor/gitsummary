Manual testing that is not covered by testGitsummary.py:

Use createScenarios.py to create folders that satisfy the test
criteria listed below.

Test    Scenario to Use     Description
1       n/a                 - Current folder not tracked by git
                            - Expected output:
                                This folder is not tracked by git.

2       detached-head       - gitsummary shows 'Detached Head' in the branch
                              list if we're in detached head state
                            - Expected output:
                                - Current branch indicator beside "Detached Head"

3       all-sections        - All sections are listed and colorized properly
                            - Confirm each section is listed, has two entries,
                              and colorized properly:
                                Stashes
                                Staged
                                Modified
                                Untracked
                                All branches

4       all-sections        - --custom is processed in proper order
                            - How to test:
                                path-to-gitsummary/gitsummary.py --custom branch-all untracked modified staged stashes

                            - Confirm each section is listed in the following order:
                                Branches (all)
                                Untracked
                                Modified
                                Staged
                                Stashes

5       all-sections        - Same as test 4, but current branch rather than all
                              branches
                            - How to test:
                                path-to-gitsummary/gitsummary.py --custom branch-current untracked modified staged stashes

                            - Confirm each section is listed in the following order:
                                Branch (current)
                                Untracked
                                Modified
                                Staged
                                Stashes

6       all-sections        - Confirm that redirecting to a file doesn't fail
                            - How to test:
                                path-to-gitsummary/gitsummary.py > gitsummary.out
                                cat gitsummary.out

                            - Confirm:
                                - gitsummary.py didn't fail
                                - the output is not empty
